# Simon-Arduino-Game

Small TEJ project for school. On/Off switch on the ground wire doesn't actually work properly because it's impossible to implement due to the way the Arduino delay() function locks up the entire program flow, but the switch was placed there anywhere because it was a requirement for the project.
